Navigating:
To navigate this program, you will be prompted to enter a number at certain menus. At the end of every method (or every time an error is caught) it will ask if you want to continue. Unless you type No or N (or any equivalents with case variations)
it will continue to the main menu

1. On start up there are a couple of pauses between outputs to give a better UX, it will take several details which are then used throughout the run of the program
2. Main menu screen
3. Option 1 on the main menu: Recommendations - this will give output without any further input required
4. Option 2 on the main menu: Conversions - this navigates to a sub menu
   4.1 Temperatures - there are two conversion options here
   4.2 Weights - there are four conversion options here
5. Option 3 on the main menu: Digital pantry - this navigates to a sub menu 
   5.1 Display ingredients
   5.2 Search ingredients
   5.3 Update ingredients - You can check this has updated by displaying ingredients again
   5.4 Add new ingredients - You can check this has updated by displaying ingredients again
